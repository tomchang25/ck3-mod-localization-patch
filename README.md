<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/tomchang25/ck3-mod-localization-patch)

Many great mods are available on Crusader Kings 3; however, not all of the mods have all language localization files. So there are many unreadable variables when people use this mod. I want to create an easy app that it'll be able to patch this mod, so people can use their native language without unreadable words like UNREAD_KEY_DES.

Here's why:
* Easy to use: you just click one button and let the app do all other jobs.
* Compatible with original translation: the app will detect original translation and only patch the sentence not included in the original translation.
